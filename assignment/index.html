    <h1>Unit 2 Assignment - Part 1</h1>
    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p>Not so much questions, as a couple observations:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Question 15 was really challenging for me; I initially was trying to nest a conditional inside of the code rather than treating it as one longer 'else if' statement.</li>
      <li>This assignment was challenging and fun to complete; I liked making up a story in the code.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I felt unsure about spaces and overall code format, so there may be some inconsistencies. But I think the code works!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>STRETCH GOAL NOTES: my first attempt is to assign mostPets as a boolean value, and let the conditional statement check the values of pets and friendsPets.</p>
